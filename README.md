# Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Introduction

The purpose of this code base is to develop and test algorithms in RL and DL space. Reinforcement Learning traced its roots back to dynamic programming and Markov Decision Processes. It lost momentum when computational challenges such as curse of dimensionality discouraged much large-scale applications. Recently, the rapid development in deep learning has dramatically changed the view of reinforcement learning. Basically, what Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis wrote in 1990's becomes achievable. We are interested in exploring synergy between RL and DL, with a focus on optimizing sequential decision making problems.
