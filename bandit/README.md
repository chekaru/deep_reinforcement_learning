# Bandit

In bandit we solve one-step decision making problem. Arguably this is simpler than sequential decision making. But the scale and complexity in real-world bandit problem make things hard. We explore such complexity here.

Even though bandit is not sequential decision making, it provides a benchmark for other algorithms.

## Key questions

### Scalability 
Performance when number of actions increases

Computational cost

### Rare event 
In many real-world bandit problems, a binary reward happens rarely. For example, on websites users 
### Convergence of optimal control policy versus accurate forecasting

### Correlation

### Non-binary reward 
Continuous distribution or mixture
